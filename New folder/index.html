        I figured it out
        I figured it out from black and white
        Seconds and hours
        Maybe they had to take some time
        I know how it goes
        I know how it goes from wrong and right
        Silence and sound
        Did they ever hold each other tight like us?
        Did they ever fight like us?
        You and I, we don't wanna be like them
        We can make it 'til the end
        Nothing can come between you and I
        Not even the Gods above
        Can separate the two of us
        No, nothing can come between you and I
        Oh, you and I
        I figured it out
        Saw the mistakes of up and down
        Meet in the middle
        There's always room for common ground
        I see what it's like
        I see what it's like for day and night
        Never together
        'Cause they see things in a different light like us
        They never tried like us
        You and I, we don't wanna be like them
        We can make it 'til the end
        Nothing can come between you and I
        Not even the Gods above

        (Two of us, two of us, two of us, two of us)
